Real Estate Price Prediction is the process of estimating or forecasting the future prices of real estate properties, such as houses, apartments, or commercial buildings. 
The goal is to provide accurate property rates to buyers, sellers, investors, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions about real estate transactions. 
If you want to learn how to predict real estate prices, this article is for you. In this article, I’ll take you through the task of Real Estate Price Prediction with Machine Learning using Python.

Real Estate Price Prediction: Process We Can Follow
To effectively predict real estate prices and support informed decision-making, we can follow this structured process:

Data Collection

Gather relevant real estate data from multiple sources, including:
Real estate databases
Government records
Online property listings
Public and private datasets
Data Cleaning and Preparation

Handle missing values by filling in, interpolating, or removing incomplete records.
Detect and remove outliers to avoid skewed predictions.
Convert categorical variables (e.g., property type, neighborhood) into numerical representations using encoding techniques.
Feature Engineering

Create new features that may improve predictive performance, such as:
Price per square foot
Distance to key locations (e.g., schools, public transport)
Economic indicators (e.g., inflation, interest rates)
Transform and normalize features to ensure consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize data distributions, trends, and correlations.
Use scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to understand relationships between variables.
Model Selection

Choose suitable machine learning algorithms, such as:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
Neural Networks (for deep learning approaches)
Model Training and Optimization

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model using training data while optimizing hyperparameters for better accuracy.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).
Prediction and Interpretation

Use the trained model to predict real estate prices.
Interpret the results and analyze key factors influencing the predictions.
Validate the model with real-world data to ensure reliability.
